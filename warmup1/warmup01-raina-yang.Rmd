###Ingredients

+ 2 large eggs
* vegetable oil
- green leaf lettuce
* yellow onion 
* carrots
* celery
* lime juice

###Special Kitchen Tools
- teaspoon
- tablespoon
- pan

####Procedure
> Heat a wok or small skillet over the highest heat. Once hot, add enough oil to reach a depth of a generous 1/4-inch. Once the oil is hot enough to smoke, carefully crack the eggs into the oil — cautiously, as they will splatter a lot — and decrease the heat to medium-high. The eggs will hiss, sputter and the whites should puff and develop translucent bubbles.  Place all salad ingredients in a large bowl. Quarter the eggs through the yolks and add them to the salad.Place the lime juice.Pour the dressing over the salad and eggs.One alternative is to use palm syrup or dark brown sugar and water as dressings.



#Euclidean Distance

####Definition
________________
The **Eclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\bar{pq})$.
In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = $(p_1, p_2,...,p_n)$ and **q** = $(q_1, q_2,...,q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:erl}
d(p,q) = d(q,p) = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2+ ... +(q_n-p_n)^2} \\
=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i-p_i)^2}         
\end{equation}

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a **Euclidean vector**. So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

\begin{equation}
      
||P|| = \sqrt{p^2_1 + p^2_2 + ... + p^2_n}= \sqrt{P\cdot P}   
\end{equation}

where the last expression involves the dot product.
