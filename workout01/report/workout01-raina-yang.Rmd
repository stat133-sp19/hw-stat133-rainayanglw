#Golden State Warriors Top Players (2016 Shot Charts & Percentages Analysis)

While the Golden State Warriors was clearly the best team in the NBA during 2015-2016 season, 2016 was't the best year for them. After the Cleveland Cavaliers' Game 6 victory, it felt like that the Warriors might have used up their talents. However, it is not breaking news that the Warriors can shoot. They often set the all-time record for effective field-goal percentage, making more than half their shots. This is a visual report on the shot data of the top Warriors players: Curry, Durant, Iguodala, Green, Thompson. It combines shot charts with summaries and visualizations to produce a straightforward view of each player's performance.

#Data Analysis for Individual Players

Stephen Curry is the greatest shooter in NBA history. This is evident in his percentages. According to Nylon Calculus's breaking down of Curry's shots from 2011-2016, Curry averaged 1.36 points per shot from 0-3 feet (accounting for free throws). Even from 24-28 feet, Curry averaged 1.37 points per shot. From 28-30 feet, Curry averaged 1.35 points per shot. In comparison, the Golden State Warrior, having the top offense in the league, average 1.14 points per possession (accounting for turnovers and offensive rebounds). It's truly unbelievable that Curry is as efficient when pulling up from six feet beyond the arc as doing layups!

According to the 2016 data below, Curry led the rank for the 3 point field goals, but lagged behind for the overall field goals percentage with a mere 46.7 percent. He probably didn't show his best self in this season, lacking the extra burst that caused him to advance to the first unanimous MVP in league history.

Klay Thompson, on the other hand, has three All-Star appearances on his resume. He also owns one of the most single-season triples among all the players. He might not be the most versatile player around. But as we will see in the data below, he's achieving a 42.4 percent of his triples, a rate Curry didn't even reach in the season. 

Andre Iguodala is a defensive player whose intentions wouldn't be so easy to decipher. It's hard to tell between his calculated pacing and slow start on the court. While he made far fewer shots than any four players, his 2 point field goal percentage is the highest at 63.8 percent. He's the one player that goes out there on the floor when the team needs to take control of a game.

Draymond Green, as can be seen through the data below, has the lowest shooting percentage for all categories among all 5 players. It causes some issue for the Warriors. When defenses force Green to shoot, he's been a little far from a satisfactory three-point shooter this season. However, he's the team's number one performer in rebounds and assist, being second in steals and blocks. He's a dominant player that is great at setting his teammates up. He's a superstar in his own way.

Kevin Durant has the highest overall shooting rate at 54.1 percent among all 5 players. His 2 point percentage at 60.7 percent is also one of the best, given that he shot more than triple times Iguodala's shooting attempts. He's a defensive menace as a 7-foot guard. While the stats say that Curry is Warriors' most important star, Durant has the most well-rounded talent.

# Overall Shot Charts for 2016 Season

As can be seen from the facetted shot charts below, the Dubs outshot their opponents in nearly every spot on the floor. While they have a great all-around system, their most valuable players were probably Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.A qualitative and quantative analysis of their shot charts from this season proves that they combined skills and efficiency beyond the arc in unmatched ways. Together, these top players are shaping the public view of perimeter offence in NBA.
